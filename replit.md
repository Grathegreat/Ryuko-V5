# Ryuko V5 - Facebook Messenger Bot

## Overview
Ryuko V5 is a Facebook Messenger bot management system with a web interface. This project allows users to create and manage multiple Facebook bot accounts through an intuitive web dashboard.

## Project Structure
- **main.js** - Main server file with Express API endpoints
- **index.js** - Entry point that spawns main.js with process management
- **config.json** - Global configuration for the bot system
- **bots.json** - Stores bot account configurations
- **states/** - Stores Facebook appstate files (JSON format)
- **botdata/** - SQLite database storage
- **script/commands/** - Bot command modules
- **script/events/** - Bot event handlers
- **public/** - Web interface files

## Setup
The application is configured to run on port 5000 and binds to 0.0.0.0 for Replit compatibility.

### Dependencies
- Node.js 20.x
- SQLite3 (rebuilt for the platform)
- Express.js for web server
- Sequelize ORM for database
- Various bot command dependencies

## Running the Application
The server automatically starts via the workflow:
```bash
node index.js
```

This spawns the main bot system which:
1. Loads configuration files
2. Initializes the database
3. Loads command and event modules
4. Starts the Express web server on port 5000
5. Manages bot account logins and listeners

## Web Interface
Access the web interface at the root URL to:
- Create new bot accounts using Facebook appstate
- Login to existing bot accounts
- View online bots
- Configure bot settings (prefix, name, admins)
- View available commands

## Database
Uses SQLite3 with Sequelize ORM. The database file is stored at:
- `botdata/database.sqlite`

## Security Notes
- Bot appstate files contain sensitive login tokens
- States are stored in `states/` directory (gitignored)
- JWT tokens are used for web authentication
- Database and appstate files are excluded from version control
